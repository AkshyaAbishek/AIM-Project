# Field Mapping Button Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The field mapping button in the AIM application was not working due to missing Python dependencies.

## Root Cause
The field mapping functionality requires `pandas` and `openpyxl` libraries for Excel operations, but these were not installed in the Python environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Dependency Installation
- Installed `pandas` and `openpyxl` packages in the virtual environment
- These packages are already listed in `requirements.txt` but weren't installed

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Configured the Python virtual environment properly
- Updated VS Code tasks to use the correct Python executable path:
  ```
  C:/Users/2013041/VibeCode/.venv/Scripts/python.exe
  ```

### 3. Verification
- Created and ran comprehensive tests to verify all field mapping functionality
- Confirmed all required methods exist and work correctly:
  - ✅ `show_field_mapping()` method
  - ✅ `create_excel_mapping()` method 
  - ✅ `browse_save_excel()` and `browse_open_excel()` methods
  - ✅ `create_dialog_button()` method
  - ✅ pandas and openpyxl imports

## How to Run the Application Correctly

### Option 1: Using VS Code Tasks (Recommended)
1. Open VS Code in the AIM project folder
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Run AIM Console Example" or "Run AIM GUI"

### Option 2: Using Terminal
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\2013041\VibeCode\AIM"
C:/Users/2013041/VibeCode/.venv/Scripts/python.exe example.py
```

## Field Mapping Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Application**: Use one of the methods above
2. **Navigate to Field Mapping**: Click the "Field Mapping" button in the GUI
3. **Select Product Type**: Choose "life" or "annuity" when prompted
4. **Configure Paths**:
   - Choose where to save the new Excel mapping file
   - Select your existing Actuarial Calculator Excel file
5. **Create Mapping**: Click "Create Mapping" to generate the Excel template

## Expected Field Mapping Dialog Features

The field mapping dialog includes:
- 📊 Product-specific headers (Life Insurance/Annuity)
- 📁 File browser buttons for easy path selection
- 📋 Clear instructions for mapping process
- ✅ Scrollable interface for better usability
- 🔧 Error handling for missing files or invalid inputs

## What the Mapping Creates

The system generates an Excel file with 4 columns:
1. **FAST UI Field**: Source field names from your data
2. **FAST UI Value**: Sample values from your data
3. **Actuarial Field**: Target fields from the calculator (to be filled)
4. **Actuarial Value**: Mapped values for the calculator (to be filled)

## Dependencies Installed

- `pandas>=1.3.0` - For Excel file manipulation
- `openpyxl` - For Excel file reading/writing
- Other dependencies from `requirements.txt`

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The field mapping button now works correctly with all required dependencies installed and proper environment configuration.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```powershell
C:/Users/2013041/VibeCode/.venv/Scripts/python.exe test_field_mapping.py
```

Expected output: "🎉 All tests passed! Field mapping should work correctly."
