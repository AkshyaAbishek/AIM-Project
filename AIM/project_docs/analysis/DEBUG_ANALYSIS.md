## Compare Route Debug Analysis

Based on the code investigation, here's what should happen:

### View Data Route (WORKING):
```python
@app.route('/view-data')
def view_data():
    all_data = db_manager.get_all_data()
    # ... stats calculation ...
    return render_template('view_data.html', data=all_data, **stats)
```

### Compare Route (FIXED):
```python
@app.route('/compare')
def compare():
    all_data = db_manager.get_all_data()  # SAME call as view_data
    processed_records = all_data          # Just rename for template
    return render_template('compare.html', processed_records=processed_records, ...)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Both routes use the same database call**: `db_manager.get_all_data()`
2. **No session filtering**: Both call without session_id parameter
3. **Same database instance**: Both use the global `db_manager`
4. **Template variables**: view_data uses `data`, compare uses `processed_records`

### Debug Output:
The compare route now includes debug prints:
- ✅ SUCCESS: X records found
- ❌ PROBLEM: No records found

### Next Steps:
1. Start the server and check the console output
2. Navigate to both pages and compare:
   - /view-data (should show records)
   - /compare (should now also show records)
3. Check the debug prints in the server console

### If Still Broken:
If compare still shows 0 records after this fix, the issue is likely:
- Database connection problems
- Timing issues (data not committed)
- Flask caching
- Different Python environments

Let me know what you see in the browser after starting the server!
