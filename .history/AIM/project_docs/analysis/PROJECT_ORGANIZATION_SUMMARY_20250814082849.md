### **Before vs After**
```
OLD STRUCTURE (Cluttered):          NEW STRUCTURE (Organized):
AIM/                               AIM/
├── web_app.py                     ├── 📁 core/web/           # Web app
├── templates/                     ├── 📁 runtime/            # Generated files
├── uploads/                       ├── 📁 development/        # Dev tools
├── test_*.py (scattered)          ├── 📁 project_docs/       # Documentation
├── *.log (scattered)              ├── 📁 database/           # Database
├── backup/ (mixed files)          ├── 📁 deployment/         # Deploy config
├── documentation/ (scattered)     └── launch_aim.py          # Main launcher
└── (100+ files in root)
```
