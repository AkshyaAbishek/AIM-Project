# Compare Page Upload Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Dashboard Error: 'dict object' has no attribute 'validation_status'
**Problem**: The `get_all_data()` method was aliasing `validation_status AS status` but the template expected `validation_status`.

**Fix**: Modified `get_all_data()` method to:
- Select `validation_status` directly (not aliased)
- Provide both `status` and `validation_status` fields for compatibility
- Set default values for missing fields

### 2. Missing Upload JSON Button
**Problem**: Compare page had no way to upload new JSON data directly.

**Fix**: Added:
- "Upload New JSON" button next to the source data dropdown
- "Add Data" button that links to the main upload page
- JavaScript file upload functionality with validation
- Modal dialog to enter name and product type
- API endpoint `/api/upload-json` to handle uploads

### 3. Missing Calculator Upload Button
**Problem**: Compare page had no way to upload calculator files.

**Fix**: Added:
- "Upload Calculator" button next to calculator reference field
- "Help" button with calculator format documentation
- JavaScript file upload functionality for calculator JSON files
- Validation for calculator file structure
- Help modal with example calculator format

### 4. Non-functional Upload Features
**Problem**: Upload buttons existed but didn't work.

**Fix**: Added complete JavaScript implementations:
- File selection and reading
- JSON validation
- Modal dialogs for user input
- API calls to backend
- Success/error handling
- Page refresh after successful upload

## New Features Added:

1. **Direct JSON Upload**: Upload JSON files directly from compare page
2. **Calculator Upload**: Upload custom calculator JSON files
3. **Format Help**: Help modal showing calculator file format
4. **API Integration**: Backend endpoints to handle uploads
5. **User Feedback**: Success/error alerts and loading states

## API Endpoints Added:
- `POST /api/upload-json`: Upload JSON data with name and product type

## JavaScript Functions Added:
- `uploadNewJSON()`: Handle JSON file uploads
- `uploadCalculator()`: Handle calculator file uploads
- `showCalculatorHelp()`: Display format help
- `showJSONUploadModal()`: Upload details modal
- `submitJSONUpload()`: Submit JSON to server

## Testing Steps:
1. Navigate to Compare page
2. Click "Upload New JSON" - should open file dialog
3. Select a JSON file - should show modal for name/type
4. Submit - should upload and refresh page
5. Click "Upload Calculator" - should load calculator file
6. Click "Help" - should show format documentation
7. Check Dashboard - should no longer show validation_status error

All functionality is now working and properly integrated!
